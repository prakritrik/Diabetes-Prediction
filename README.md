# Diabetes-Prediction

# Project Overview

This project uses the **PIMA Indians Diabetes dataset** to build a machine learning model for predicting whether a person has diabetes based on specific diagnostic measurements. The dataset is sourced from the **National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases**.

The primary goal is to develop a predictive system using **Support Vector Machine (SVM)** with a linear kernel to classify individuals as **diabetic (1)** or **non-diabetic (0)** based on their health data.
